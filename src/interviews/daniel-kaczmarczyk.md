**Who are you? Where are you from? What's your backstory?**

My name is Daniel and I’m from London, but I grew up in Poland. I’ve been coding since I was a kid, but never thought of it as a career for me. After a 5 year hiatus I decided at the age of 24 to resume programming and I haven’t looked back since.

<br>

**What made you get into programming?**

I started at school, but the subjects that were being covered weren’t appealing to me and I became discouraged to continue down this particular route which looking back was a big mistake. After getting my Masters degree (non-CS) I landed somewhat accidentally in a role that gave me a chance to be immersed in a community of developers; as time progressed this inspired me to pick up my previous knowledge and apply it moving forward.

<br>

**What does your process for learning to code look like?**

First I watch tutorials/read blog posts/read a book or consume the topic in any other passive way. After that, I replicate whatever I have just learnt applying the skills taught to me. After replication, I write a ‘lesson’ of my own as I strongly believe that being able to teach something is the minimum skill level for being certain that you know something.

<br>

**What does your process for building apps look like?**

I iterate quickly. Build a single, tiny feature, test it, present to the client. This loop takes from a day up to a couple weeks, depending on the feature. Super agile!

<br>

**Are you currently learning anything new?**

Always. Currently working on natural language generation.

<br>

**What's your tech stack?**

JS (React, Redux) for majority of things browser-related, Node && Python on the server. C++ for learning.

<br>

**Advice for those learning to code?**

It will be hard and unpleasant for the first couple years, but at some point you’ll grasp enough to feel more comfortable. Stick to it and you will see results that you can be proud of.

**Shameless Plug** 

Nothing more than my Twitter [@_daniel_tweets](https://twitter.com/_daniel_tweets) .and my homepage[: https://danielk.co.uk](https://danielk.co.uk/)

**Any hot picks?**

[papaparse.com](http://papaparse.com/) is a great CSV parsing tool that saved my butt on the current project I’m working on!
