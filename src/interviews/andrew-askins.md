answerOne: "Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew. Iâ€™m the CEO of Krit, an app development agency that works with non-technical founders at early
    stage startups. I grew up in Columbia, SC - a sleepy southern city with about 100,000 people in the city proper. I
    started Krit while I was in college studying Computer Science (I was actually studying abroad in Scotland at the
    time).
    
    ssI worked as an iOS developer before starting Krit. For the first 3 years of our life as a company, I was primarily a front-end developer. Two years ago I stopped writing code full-time and embraced the CEO role. These days I spend my time focusing on sales, marketing and working with clients. It has absolutely been the right step for me, although my experience working as a programmer first continues to help me every day. "
