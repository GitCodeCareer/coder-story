**Who are you? Where are you from? What's your backstory?**

My name is Pat Walls, I’m 28 years old, and I am from Jackson Hole, Wyoming USA - although I’ve moved around for most of my life.

<br>

I haven’t always been a developer. My backstory mostly consists of me jumping around different careers, interests, and hobbies. Over the last few years, I’ve been working mostly as a developer and entrepreneur and running some side businesses.

<br>

I’m really looking forward to this interview because there are so many unique ways people get into coding. Unlike many other professions, where there’s usually a very clear path for success, coding is different, and I love that. I also love how ANYONE can learn.

<br>

But it also creates a lot of noise, people say “you should do this” or “you should do that”. Different things work for different people, and this is what worked for me!

**What made you get into programming?** 

Basically, I got into programming after feeling not challenged at work.

<br>

I was working at a tech company in San Francisco doing some technical work with enterprise software. Before that, I was doing accounting, so I really enjoyed this new more technical, creative work I was doing.

<br>

But quickly, I felt like I mastered the work, and I wanted a bigger challenge. I also didn’t want to pigeonhole myself with these very specific enterprise software skills I was learning. I wanted to learn how to really code and build software.

<br>

This was about three years ago when boot camps were just starting to take off. I heard about a boot camp in San Francisco that guarantees you a job (or you don’t have to pay at all), and I immediately signed up.

<br>

The boot camp was the most intense thing I’ve done in my life. I learned how to code and was “software engineer ready” in 3 months (well, I still sucked but impressive how much I learned in that short span of time).

<br>

After the boot camp, I got a job as a software engineer and the rest was history :)

<br>

**What does your process for learning to code look like?** 

I’m a hack.

<br>

For me, I don’t enjoy reading books, documentation, or other written stuff about programming. It’s hard for me to grasp how the code works unless I get my hands dirty. 

<br>

My attention span is short, and I find reading articles about programming to be like watching paint dry.

<br>

I learn by trying to code to solve whatever problem. That is when things “click” for me.

<br>

If I need to learn a new language or framework, I like to use tutorials that help me take things step by step until I can get the hang of things.

<br>

For me, just building stuff over and over helps me learn. I’m not very good at understanding how things work the first time around. It usually takes me a couple attempts.

<br>

For example, when I was trying to get better at React, I remember just working on lots of fun little projects which helped me improve.

<br>

**What does your process for building apps look like?** 

I build all my apps in Ruby on Rails or React. 

<br>

I learned this stack in my boot camp, and I don’t have any particular interest in learning a new framework unless it’s necessary (like I had to build a mobile app or something).

<br>

When I build an app, I usually start by implementing the absolute core features first, because I want to see if the thing I’m doing is actually possible or as cool as I think it is in my head - and we’ve all experienced how building that part is the most exciting as well.

<br>

Then I do a bunch of design stuff to try to make it look like how I envisioned. I like to implement things really quickly so I don’t lose my original vision of how it looks and feels.

<br>

After that I do the boring stuff, like user login, meta tags, image uploads, etc etc.

<br>

My code is also extremely “hacky” as I always tell myself I’ll fix it later, and usually don’t. I’m pretty lazy like that.

<br>

**Are you currently learning anything new?** 

Not any new frameworks, but with my projects, there always feels like there’s something new I need to learn.

<br>

Like for example, I heard I need to use schema.org tags on all my pages? Lots of SEO stuff.

<br>

I try to automate as many things as possible, so I’m always learning more things around that, like handling workers, errors, retries, image asset generation, APIs, etc.

<br>

**What's your tech stack?** 

\- Rails

\- React (Sometimes) for UI intense stuff

\- Postgres

\- Heroku

\- Sidekiq

\- S3 for storing files

\- HAML templates

\- Devise for user logins

\- SendGrid for emails

\- Sentry for error reporting

\- New Relic & Google Analytics

\- Bootstrap for design stuff

<br>

**Advice for those learning to code?**

Build your own projects!

<br>

If you’re really new to coding, don’t use codecademy - in my opinion, it’s a dreadful way to learn. 

<br>

Stop spending weeks reading up on the “fundamentals”. Just dive right in and build stuff. Like I said earlier, getting my hands dirty really works well for me.

<br>

Sometimes the most painful thing (esp when you’re new) is to just get your environment set up. Check out tutorials and YouTube videos for that. Also just google, copy/paste any time you get stuck and you’ll eventually fix it :)

**Hot Picks**

I really like this meta tags project by Moe Amaya. I also like Uber Suggest, a free keyword research tool.

<br>

I love using Streak, a CRM for Gmail. And Klaviyo for all of my email newsletters.

Big fan of similarweb.com. Blurt.app is an awesome writing tool.
