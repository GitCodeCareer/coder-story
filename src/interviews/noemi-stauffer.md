**Who are you? Where are you from? What's your backstory?**

Hi, I’m Noemi. I’m a Swiss and Canadian entrepreneur based in Barcelona. After graduating from the Master of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at ESADE Business School, I started my career by working in healthcare innovation. However, I wasn’t feeling passionate about it, so I eventually resigned and turned to tech.

<br>

Given my business background, I started working as a project manager in a digital studio. There, I grew more interested in what my team was doing (design and development) rather than my manager’s responsibilities. I soon felt the need to start working on my projects, and with a better understanding of the possibilities in tech, started two:[Fresh Fonts](http://freshfonts.io/), a curated newsletter sharing the newest font releases of independent designers, including free and open source typefaces, and [Flow Supply Co](http://flowsupply.co/), an online gallery of prints and posters made by digital artists.

<br>

**What made you get into programming?**

Working on my own projects, I started making websites using services that are available to everyone, without having to write a single line of code. However, I quickly felt limited, and wanted to ‘graduate’ from templates without having to pay and depend on a developer.

<br>

Although the idea had been on my mind for a while, what really encouraged me to get started was to realise that programming is much more accessible than I thought – there are plenty of good resources to help you, and the tech community is very supportive. In the process, I realised that working as a freelance developer could be a well-paid sideline to earn revenues while growing my own projects, which became an extra source of motivation.

<br>

**What does your process for learning to code look like?**

Although there are plenty of resources available for self-learning, I felt the need for some guidance, and wanted a clear structure to learn front-end development. I therefore signed up for[the front-end foundation course](https://www.superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation) at SuperHi, which is fully online, but they also send you well-written book to make sure that you get the basics right. Therefore, every week, I start by reading the relevant chapters in the book, then follow the videos provided in the course to make a new website, and finally, recreate a similar website from scratch, as a homework. Lastly, I ask the teachers to review my homework, just to make sure that my code is optimal and that I didn’t miss on any learning.

<br>

**Are you currently learning anything new?**

Yes, as I’m about midway into the course now, I’m starting to learn Javascript. I’m also fine-tuning my skills when it comes to the Flexbox layout model, and after that, would like to give CSS grid a go.

<br>

**Advice for those learning to code?**

As for me, I struggled a bit to learn how to make multi-column websites using floats, so if it was to do all over again, I would skip that part and go straight to the Flexbox model, which was much more intuitive for me. So if you are learning front-end development, I would recommend doing just that.

<br>

Also, this is a bit more random, but I recently found out that I was overpaying for hosting and domain names. So, screw GoDaddy! Just ask experienced developers for their best, cheapest solutions and I’m sure you’ll find something that works for you.

<br>

**What's your tech stack?**

I can summarise it in only three products:[](https://www.superhi.com/learn-to-code-now-book)

\- [the SuperHi book](https://www.superhi.com/learn-to-code-now-book)(yeah, I still love to learn by reading, I guess I got used to it in college)

\- the SuperHi code editor, which is so beginner-friendly (it’s only available for students though)

\- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). I use it to keep all my learnings and coding resources neatly organised.

<br>

PS I know it sounds like I sold my soul to [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/), but I honestly really enjoy learning with them. The teachers provide quick and helpful feedback via Slack, and they have a great, supportive community of students doing [inspiring work](https://www.superhi.com/hall-of-fame) which keeps me highly engaged. They offer plenty of courses, from WordPress customisation to front-end and back-end languages, so if you are interested in learning with them, you can use my referral to benefit from a discount:<https://www.superhi.com/?r=Noemi>. Or, if you’re not sure it might be the best solution for you, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/noemistauffer) and I’ll be happy to help!
