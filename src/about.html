            By sharing your stories we want to create conversations that will not only provide knowledge and support for
            the makers of today, but for those who want to be inspired as the creators of tomorrow. The industry is
            always expanding and by detailing your journey there is an opportunity to provide a blueprint for the

            Coderstory was born from the mind of Jessica Wallace, an evolving maker who wanted to challenge the norm and
            find a way to make the community more tight-knit. In a sea of platforms where creators can come together,
            her mission is to invite people from all walks of life to share, educate and celebrate their hard work.
