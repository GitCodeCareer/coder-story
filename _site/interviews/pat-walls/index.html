Who are you? Where are you from? What's your backstory?
<p>My name is Pat Walls, I’m 28 years old, and I am from Jackson Hole, Wyoming USA - although I’ve moved around for most of my life.</p>
<p>I haven’t always been a developer. My backstory mostly consists of me jumping around different careers, interests, and hobbies. Over the last few years, I’ve been working mostly as a developer and entrepreneur and running some side businesses.</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to this interview because there are so many unique ways people get into coding. Unlike many other professions, where there’s usually a very clear path for success, coding is different, and I love that. I also love how ANYONE can learn.</p>
<p>But it also creates a lot of noise, people say “you should do this” or “you should do that”. Different things work for different people, and this is what worked for me!</p>
<p>What made you get into programming?</p>
<p>Basically, I got into programming after feeling not challenged at work.</p>
<p>I was working at a tech company in San Francisco doing some technical work with enterprise software. Before that, I was doing accounting, so I really enjoyed this new more technical, creative work I was doing.</p>
<p>But quickly, I felt like I mastered the work, and I wanted a bigger challenge. I also didn’t want to pigeonhole myself with these very specific enterprise software skills I was learning. I wanted to learn how to really code and build software.</p>
<p>This was about three years ago when boot camps were just starting to take off. I heard about a boot camp in San Francisco that guarantees you a job (or you don’t have to pay at all), and I immediately signed up.</p>
<p>The boot camp was the most intense thing I’ve done in my life. I learned how to code and was “software engineer ready” in 3 months (well, I still sucked but impressive how much I learned in that short span of time).</p>
<p>After the boot camp, I got a job as a software engineer and the rest was history :)</p>
<p>What does your process for learning to code look like?</p>
<p>I’m a hack.</p>
<p>For me, I don’t enjoy reading books, documentation, or other written stuff about programming. It’s hard for me to grasp how the code works unless I get my hands dirty.</p>
<p>My attention span is short, and I find reading articles about programming to be like watching paint dry.</p>
<p>I learn by trying to code to solve whatever problem. That is when things “click” for me.</p>
<p>If I need to learn a new language or framework, I like to use tutorials that help me take things step by step until I can get the hang of things.</p>
<p>For me, just building stuff over and over helps me learn. I’m not very good at understanding how things work the first time around. It usually takes me a couple attempts.</p>
<p>For example, when I was trying to get better at React, I remember just working on lots of fun little projects which helped me improve.</p>
<p>What does your process for building apps look like?</p>
<p>I build all my apps in Ruby on Rails or React.</p>
<p>I learned this stack in my boot camp, and I don’t have any particular interest in learning a new framework unless it’s necessary (like I had to build a mobile app or something).</p>
<p>When I build an app, I usually start by implementing the absolute core features first, because I want to see if the thing I’m doing is actually possible or as cool as I think it is in my head - and we’ve all experienced how building that part is the most exciting as well.</p>
<p>Then I do a bunch of design stuff to try to make it look like how I envisioned. I like to implement things really quickly so I don’t lose my original vision of how it looks and feels.</p>
<p>After that I do the boring stuff, like user login, meta tags, image uploads, etc etc.</p>
<p>My code is also extremely “hacky” as I always tell myself I’ll fix it later, and usually don’t. I’m pretty lazy like that.</p>
<p>Are you currently learning anything new?</p>
<p>Not any new frameworks, but with my projects, there always feels like there’s something new I need to learn.</p>
<p>Like for example, I heard I need to use schema.org tags on all my pages? Lots of SEO stuff.</p>
<p>I try to automate as many things as possible, so I’m always learning more things around that, like handling workers, errors, retries, image asset generation, APIs, etc.</p>
<p>What's your tech stack?</p>
<p>Rails</p>
<p>React (Sometimes) for UI intense stuff</p>
<p>Postgres</p>
<p>Heroku</p>
<p>Sidekiq</p>
<p>S3 for storing files</p>
<p>HAML templates</p>
<p>Devise for user logins</p>
<p>SendGrid for emails</p>
<p>Sentry for error reporting</p>
<p>New Relic &amp; Google Analytics</p>
<p>Bootstrap for design stuff</p>
<p>Advice for those learning to code?</p>
<p>Build your own projects!</p>
<p>If you’re really new to coding, don’t use codecademy - in my opinion, it’s a dreadful way to learn.</p>
<p>Stop spending weeks reading up on the “fundamentals”. Just dive right in and build stuff. Like I said earlier, getting my hands dirty really works well for me.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most painful thing (esp when you’re new) is to just get your environment set up. Check out tutorials and YouTube videos for that. Also just google, copy/paste any time you get stuck and you’ll eventually fix it :)</p>
