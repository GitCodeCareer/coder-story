                                    <p><strong>Who are you? Where are you from? What's your backstory?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Sarah Jackson. I'm from Chicago, IL but have lived in Portland, OR since 2002. In college I received a Bachelors in Sustainable Agriculture and then went back and received another one in Computer Science. Upon graduating, I decided to utilise the Computer Science degree and needles to say I've been working for a Fortune 500 Financial Services company for 17 years. I have a beautiful wife and 2 awesome kids.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What made you get into programming?</strong></p>
<p>I've always been into computers. I'm a Generation X kid, I grew up in the 80's. Our first computer was a Texas Instruments TI 99 which I used to create computer games (following tutorials from a book my dad brought home) in a language called TI Basic.</p>
<br>
<p>Fast forward 30 years... I was talking to friends of mine that owned businesses, trying to uncover problems they were experiencing that could be solved with software (trying to find ideas for software to build). A friend of mine who ran a very successful Airbnb management company said she had a huge pain point in keeping up with guest communication (I will spare you the painful details).</p>
<br>
<p>Without even researching to see if it was feasible, I told her I could build her a solution. So there I was, hadn't touched programming since college and I had this friend who was expecting me to deliver! I saved up a bunch of money and hired a ‚Äògig‚Äô company that said they could build me an MVP. Perfect! Well, the MVP they built me was too &quot;M&quot; and not even close to a Viable Product.</p>
<br>
<p>Plus, it took them way longer than it should have. In the meantime, my friend had moved on to a different software solution and I was stuck with a crappy piece of software. I still had my landing page up and was getting signups and collecting email addresses. So I said screw it, I'll build it myself.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What does your process for learning to code look like?</strong></p>
<p>I watched an 8 hour Lynda.com tutorial and for the rest I have relied on Stack Overflow and Google.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What does your process for building apps look like?</strong></p>
<p>It involves a lot of'Ctrl+Z'! A lot of trial and error.I usually have a pretty good overview in my head about how I want the finished product to be, but I start out by defining the database, keeping in mind CRUD functionality.</p>
<br>
<p>I will then write the code that makes the app do it's thing, then lastly I worry about CSS. I should probably pay closer attention to the CSS because it always feels like an afterthought.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Are you currently learning anything new?</strong></p>
<p>I'm currently trying to wrap my brain around JavaScript.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What's your tech stack?</strong></p>
<p>- PHP</p>
<p>- MySQL</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Advice for those learning to code?</strong></p>
<p>Don't give up. The best way to learn is by doing, so just start making things. Start small if you have to.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Shameless Plugs</strong></p>
<p>The first app I made was the Airbnb one, Bnbboss. It's been temporarily shelved because Airbnb found out I was reverse engineering their API and deleted all my hosting accounts. I have since applied for an API license, but they refused me because I don't have enough of a client base for the app...catch 22 I guess. So I pivoted to an industry that I'm much more passionate about.I'm currently working on Inweed.io. It's a job board for the emerging Cannabis industry. I also recently made Product Hunt Clock as a fun side project.</p>

<p><strong>Hot Picks</strong></p>
<p>I'm really into everything that comes out of Women Make. I'm also a WIP member, it's really cool to see the products coming from there too.</p>
