                                    <p><strong>Who are you? Where are you from? What's your backstory?</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Noemi. I’m a Swiss and Canadian entrepreneur based in Barcelona. After graduating from the Master of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at ESADE Business School, I started my career by working in healthcare innovation. However, I wasn’t feeling passionate about it, so I eventually resigned and turned to tech.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/coderstory/image/upload/v1549274179/Interview%20Image%20Gallery/General_Type_Home.gif" alt=""></p>
<br>
<p>Given my business background, I started working as a project manager in a digital studio. There, I grew more interested in what my team was doing (design and development) rather than my manager’s responsibilities. I soon felt the need to start working on my projects, and with a better understanding of the possibilities in tech, started two:<a href="http://freshfonts.io/">Fresh Fonts</a>, a curated newsletter sharing the newest font releases of independent designers, including free and open source typefaces, and <a href="http://flowsupply.co/">Flow Supply Co</a>, an online gallery of prints and posters made by digital artists.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What made you get into programming?</strong></p>
<p>Working on my own projects, I started making websites using services that are available to everyone, without having to write a single line of code. However, I quickly felt limited, and wanted to ‘graduate’ from templates without having to pay and depend on a developer.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/coderstory/image/upload/v1549274227/Interview%20Image%20Gallery/Screenshot_2018-11-16_at_16.18.57.png" alt=""></p>
<br>
<p>Although the idea had been on my mind for a while, what really encouraged me to get started was to realise that programming is much more accessible than I thought – there are plenty of good resources to help you, and the tech community is very supportive. In the process, I realised that working as a freelance developer could be a well-paid sideline to earn revenues while growing my own projects, which became an extra source of motivation.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What does your process for learning to code look like?</strong></p>
<p>Although there are plenty of resources available for self-learning, I felt the need for some guidance, and wanted a clear structure to learn front-end development. I therefore signed up for<a href="https://www.superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation">the front-end foundation course</a> at SuperHi, which is fully online, but they also send you well-written book to make sure that you get the basics right. Therefore, every week, I start by reading the relevant chapters in the book, then follow the videos provided in the course to make a new website, and finally, recreate a similar website from scratch, as a homework. Lastly, I ask the teachers to review my homework, just to make sure that my code is optimal and that I didn’t miss on any learning.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Are you currently learning anything new?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as I’m about midway into the course now, I’m starting to learn Javascript. I’m also fine-tuning my skills when it comes to the Flexbox layout model, and after that, would like to give CSS grid a go.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Advice for those learning to code?</strong></p>
<p>As for me, I struggled a bit to learn how to make multi-column websites using floats, so if it was to do all over again, I would skip that part and go straight to the Flexbox model, which was much more intuitive for me. So if you are learning front-end development, I would recommend doing just that.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, this is a bit more random, but I recently found out that I was overpaying for hosting and domain names. So, screw GoDaddy! Just ask experienced developers for their best, cheapest solutions and I’m sure you’ll find something that works for you.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What's your tech stack?</strong></p>
<p>I can summarise it in only three products:<a href="https://www.superhi.com/learn-to-code-now-book"></a></p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.superhi.com/learn-to-code-now-book">the SuperHi book</a>(yeah, I still love to learn by reading, I guess I got used to it in college)</p>
<p>- the SuperHi code editor, which is so beginner-friendly (it’s only available for students though)</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>. I use it to keep all my learnings and coding resources neatly organised.</p>
<br>
<p>PS I know it sounds like I sold my soul to <a href="https://www.superhi.com/">SuperHi</a>, but I honestly really enjoy learning with them. The teachers provide quick and helpful feedback via Slack, and they have a great, supportive community of students doing <a href="https://www.superhi.com/hall-of-fame">inspiring work</a> which keeps me highly engaged. They offer plenty of courses, from WordPress customisation to front-end and back-end languages, so if you are interested in learning with them, you can use my referral to benefit from a discount:<a href="https://www.superhi.com/?r=Noemi">https://www.superhi.com/?r=Noemi</a>. Or, if you’re not sure it might be the best solution for you, ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/noemistauffer">Twitter</a> and I’ll be happy to help!</p>
