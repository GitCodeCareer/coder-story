                                    <p><strong>Who are you? Where are you from and what is your backstory?</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™m Benjamin Spak born in New York and raised in central Florida. T-shaped front-end web developer &amp; digital marketing veteran. Passion for crafting intuitive user experiences. Self-motivated, collaborative, with a strong sense of JS, UI, UX, CRO &amp; SEO best practices.</p>
<br>
<p><em>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</em></p>
<p>-  Worked with notable clients: Smucker, Wells Fargo, Karma Automotive, Signature Flight Support, KMI International, Wiley Publishing &amp; Tickets At Work (EBG).</p>
<p>- Developed object-oriented JavaScript web applications for high transactional sites that earn over $17 Million in revenue per week.</p>
<p>- Enhanced communications at the Space Life Sciences Lab (SLSL) for CASIS. Created a 6-computer communications center to facilitate transmission of mission-critical information to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
<p>- Founded the #301DaysofCode initiative to inspire &amp; advocate for Jr. web developers.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What made you get into programming?</strong></p>
<p>In a word â€˜Myspaceâ€™. I know, yikes, and elder millennial! I think Myspace and Neopets got several people on board. Initially, I wanted to be a designer, so I picked up some photoshop, and did custom Myspace layouts for a few local bands and businesses in high school.<br>
<br></p>
<p>After taking a few additional courses in web design in high school, I learned the now dated process of creating a layout in Photoshop, slicing them &amp; coding them in Dreamweaver. When it came time to learn PHP I hit a wall and set aside coding for around 5 years. Eventually, while bored in the Air Force I began to pick it back up, along with online marketing.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What made you create #301DaysOfCode?</strong></p>
<p>While I had been freelancing &amp; contracting doing mostly SEO, IT &amp; Wordpress sites for clients I still didnâ€™t know much about actually programming. Sure, I knew HTML, CSS well but I wanted to dive deeper into PHP, Javascript &amp; Python.</p>
<br>
<p>I started #301DaysOfCode because I wanted to take myself from being an internet generalist to a programmer within the year. My plan was to build on my knowledge base for 301 days and then use the remaining 64 days to find a job. Without intending to, I wound up inspiring a few people to join me in my journey. Now, #301DaysOfCode continues to grow! Iâ€™m astonished and really proud of what community members have achieved by dedicating themselves to the challenge.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What does your process for learning to code look like?</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™m a bit of a slacker and scatter brained, Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m the best person to learn code from haha. While Iâ€™m working with code now, Iâ€™m still very much a generalist. Iâ€™ve sampled a bit of Ruby, Javascript, Python, PHP &amp; several of the frameworks that tie into them. I love seeing where their approaches overlap and where they differ. I think, personally, thatâ€™s how I learn best; finding the patterns in code &amp; languages.<br><br>
I usually, use last minute learning. This is where I will provide a longer project timeline so that I can pick up new skills and learn new things as a project calls for it. Usually, Iâ€™ll have a work project act as a forcing function to spur me to learn something new in order to complete a task.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What does your process for building apps look like?</strong></p>
<p>My approach depends on if Iâ€™m working on the front-end, back-end or fullstack. If working on the front typically Iâ€™ll start with a wireframe and then do a low fidelity mockup because it makes it easier to sell the concept to management.</p>
<br>
<p>If Iâ€™m working on the back or full-stack then Iâ€™ll write out the logical steps needed to complete the functionality of the project. Usually, writing the steps out as comments. Then, Iâ€™ll build out the necessary features described in each comment. Once I have all of the disjointed functionality down, Iâ€™ll refactor the code with clearer variables and function names and remove most of the code comments.</p>
<br>
<p>I very much buy into the clean code approach; code should read like English. Functions and variables should be self explanatory and not leave you scratching your head about what a function or class does when you get back to work on the code after the weekend. Keeping this approach &amp; mindset helps make it easier for anyone else who may read your code in the future as well.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Do you face any particular challenges when building over a period of time?</strong></p>
<p>I quickly lose interest in projects. Unless, Iâ€™m getting paid for them, I rarely enjoy working on something long term, my attention span is too short.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Are you currently learning anything new?</strong></p>
<p>Right now Iâ€™m focused on honing my Django and Python data science skills. Within the next year I would like to put those skills towards machine learning so that I can further automate my workflow.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Advice for those learning to code?</strong></p>
<p>Learn from as many sources as possible. I know several newbies who â€˜learn to codeâ€™ on platforms like freeCodeCamp or CodeCademy and then think they are job ready. Unfortunately, when they do interviews they are woefully unprepared to solve challenges on their own.</p>
<br>
<p>Donâ€™t make the mistake of going through an institution, college, boot camp, or online course and think it prepares you. Knowledge is not experience. Iâ€™ll repeat that because itâ€™s important;  knowledge is not experience. Experience is continued failure. Experience leads to success.</p>
<br>
<p>If you want to be a quality programmer, you need to learn to be comfortable with failing potentially hundreds of times before you get a program to work properly. Donâ€™t let that scare you off! Be bold and brave in the face of challenges!</p>
<br>
<p>For the difficulty it brings with it, programming is a fantastic career choice! Great pay, an awesome and supportive community and youâ€™re always learning something new! If you love learning, and you like a challenge stick with it! It may take a few years to get to the point where you can make the apps you dream up. Ultimately, learning to code is like learning to read a book; it is now an essential skill.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Whatâ€™s your tech stack?</strong></p>
<p>Being more of a generalist, it really depends on the problem set Iâ€™m working on. I could use bash and cron jobs to automate server side tasks, python or javascript libraries for headless browser tasks, a web library such as jQuery for DOM manipulation or a framework like Wordpress with Woocommerce to build a eCommerce solution.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What have been influential books, resources and links that have helped you?</strong></p>
<p>I am a firm believer all sources of information are not created equal. You either get the best, or you waste your time.</p>
<br>
<p>In my opinion. Donâ€™t buy programming books. They are usually outdated by the time they are published.</p>
